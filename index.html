          <h1 class="primary-color">Palawan</h1>
          <p id="one">Palawan, one of the best places to visit in the Philippines, is consistently ranked as one of the best islands in the world, and for a good reason.</p>
          <p id="two">It boasts white sand beaches and islands, clear blue waters, a spectacular variety of marine life and shipwreck sites, and majestic towering limestone cliffs. If you love swimming, island-hopping, and diving, this biggest island province in the Philippines should be in your travel bucket list. </p>
          <p id="three">Palawan has over 1,700 pristine islands and islets scattered in its four main destinations: El Nido, Puerto Princesa, Coron, and San Vicente.</p>
          <p id="four">One of the top Palawan destinations is the UNESCO World Heritage Site and New 7 Wonders of Nature, the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, or the Underground River.</p>
          <p id="five">El Nido is known as the ultimate tropical paradise because of its stunning beaches and islands. At the northern end of Palawan island is Coron that is famous for its shipwreck and crystal clear lagoons.</p>
          <p id="six">Last but not least is the emerging Palawan destination, San Vicente, where you can find Long Beach, the longest beach in the Philippines, and the popular beach town of Port Barton. If you want to explore this top island destination in the Philippines, read this ultimate travel guide to Palawan.</p>
          <p id="seven">The majority of your activities in Palawan are highly dependent on the weather because they're located outdoors. That's why it's best to plan your trip around the dry months in the Philippines and check weather updates first to avoid canceled tours or rough currents, especially when doing island-hopping tours in Palawan. </p>

Wave hello to endangered animals at the Calauit Game Preserve and Wildlife Sanctuary or explore the Japanese shipwrecks of Coron Island, regarded as one of the best dive sites in the world.
